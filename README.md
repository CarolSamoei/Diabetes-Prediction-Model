# Diabetes-Prediction-Model
Developing a model that predicts if one has diabetes or not

# PROBLEM STATEMENT

The objective of this project is to build a model to predict whether a patient has diabetes or not based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.

# Objective

The goal of this project is to develop an accurate and reliable machine-learning model that can predict whether a patient has diabetes or not. By predicting diabetes early, patients can receive early intervention and avoid complications associated with the disease. Deploy the best model using gradio

# Data Dictionary

The dataset consists of medical data for 768 patients. It includes the following features:

Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant

Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test

BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)

SkinThickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)

Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)

BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
